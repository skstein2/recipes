Place 2 paper towels on a large plate. Crack 1 egg in a small bowl. Gently swirl your water with a spatula in one direction and slowly pour the egg into the center of the pot. Gently swirl the water a few times around the egg then let it be for 4 minutes. Carefully remove with a slotted spoon and drain on the paper towels; repeat for each egg, using the same water.; Heat a pan over medium with a drizzle of oil. Place the onion in the pan with a good pinch of salt and let it cook, stirring every minute or so, for about 8 minutes. Add the garlic, cumin, and chili powder and cook for another minute. Return the pot of water to just below a simmer. Add the bell pepper to the pan and cook for another 3-4 minutes, stirring once in a while, until just starting to soften. Add the corn and black beans and cook until hot. Stir in the adobo sauce and turn to low.; Place all eggs gently back in the warm water and let them reheat for no longer than 1 minute. Place potato slabs on 2 plates with the veggie mixture over top. Remove eggs with a slotted spoon or place on the paper towel to drain the water and then place them on top of the veggie mixture (2 for each serving). Top with the avocado hollandaise, salt, pepper, and hot sauce if desired. Serve immediately. | Home; Recipes; Trusted Brands: Recipes and Tips; U.S. Potato Board
