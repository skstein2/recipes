Store the unused portion of the spice mix for future use.; Place aluminum foil on lower rack to capture drippings and prevent flare-ups. Lay the ribs on the top rack of the grill (away from the coals, if you're using briquettes). Reduce gas heat to low, close lid, and leave undisturbed for 1 hour. Do not lift the lid at all.; Brush ribs with barbecue sauce, and grill an additional 5 minutes.
